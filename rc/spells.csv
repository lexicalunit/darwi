"0";"Mage Hand";"Conjuration Cantrip";"1 action";"30 feet";"V, S";"1 minute";" A spectral, floating hand appears at a point you choose within range. The hand lasts for the duration or until you dismiss it as an action. The hand vanishes if it is ever more than 30 feet away from you or if you cast this spell again. You can use your action to control the hand. You can use the hand to manipulate an object, open an unlocked floor or container, stow or retrieve an item from an open container, or pour the contents out of a vial. You can move the hand up to 30 feet each time you use it. The hand can't attack, activate magical items, or carry more than 10 pounds."
"0";"Minor Illusion";"Illusion cantrip";"1 action";"30 feet";"S, M ";"1 minute";"(a bit of fleece) You create a sound or an image of an object within range that lasts for the duration. The illusion also ends if you dismiss it as an action or cast this spell again. If you create a sound, its volume can range from a whisper to a scream. It can be your voice, someone else’s voice, a lion’s roar, a beating of drums, or any other sound you choose. The sound continues unabated throughout the duration, or you can make discrete sounds at different times before the spell ends. If you create an image of an object—such as a chair, muddy footprints, or a small chest—it must be no larger than a 5-foot cube. The image can’t create sound, light, smell, or any other sensory effect. Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. If a creature uses its action to examine the sound or image, the creature can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the illusion becomes faint to the creature."

"0";"Thaumaturgy";"Transmutation cantrip";"1 action";"30 feet";"V";"Up to 1 minute";"You manifest a minor wonder, a sign of supernatural power, within range.

"1";"Tasha's Hideous Laughter";"1st level enchantment";"1 action";"30 feet";"V, S, M ";"Concentration, up to 1 minute";"(tiny tarts and a feather that is waved in the air)    A creature of your choice that you can see within range perceives everything as hilariously funny and falls into fits of laughter if this spell affects it. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or fall prone, becoming incapacitated and unable to stand up for the duration. A creature with an Intelligence score of 4 or less isn’t affected. <br>  At the end of each of its turns, and each time it takes damage, the target can make another Wisdom saving throw. The target has advantage on the saving throw if it’s triggered by damage. On a success, the spell ends."
"1";"Dissonant Whispers";"1st level enchantment";"1 action";"60 feet";"V";"Instantaneous";"You whisper a discordant melody that only one creature of your choice within range can hear, wracking it with terrible pain. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 3d6 psychic damage and must immediately use its reaction, if available, to move as far as its speed allows away from you. The creature doesn't move into obviously dangerous ground, such as a fire or a pit. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage and doesn't have to move away. A deafened creature automatically succeeds on the save.<br><b>At Higher Levels.</b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st."
"1";"Command";"1st level Enchantment";"1 action";"60 feet";"V";"1 round";" You speak a one-word command to a creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or follow the command on its next turn. The spell has no effect if the target is undead, if it doesn’t understand your language, or if your command is directly harmful to it.  Some typical commands and their effects follow. You might issue a command other than one described here. If you do so, the DM determines how the target behaves. If the target can’t follow your command, the spell ends.  Approach. The target moves toward you by the shortest and most direct route, ending its turn if it moves within 5 feet of you.  Drop. The target drops whatever it is holding and then ends its turn.  Flee. The target spends its turn moving away from you by the fastest available means.  Grovel. The target falls prone and then ends its turn.  Halt. The target doesn’t move and takes no actions. A flying creature stays aloft, provided that it is able to do so. If it must move to stay aloft, it flies the minimum distance needed to remain in the air.  At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can affect one additional creature for each slot level above 1st. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them."
