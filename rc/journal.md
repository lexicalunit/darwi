# Introductions
Kobolds were attacking a village, there was a blue dragon attacking the city named Lennithon. Saved a man woman and three kids. Were able to talk to a captured cultist about the Dragon cult, they are looting the town for treasure. Made it to a fort and rested. The mayor of the city noticed that the mill was on fire, so we went to try and save the mill. Went through a tunnel and came out into the mill and was ambushed. We were able to kill all of our attackers though we took heavy damage from the surprise attack.

# Greenest Under Attack
Helped rescue people being attacked at a temple. Kobolds were attempting to enter it using a battering ram. We avoided the patrol and went in the back entrance, through a smaller group of kobolds that were trying to smoke out the survivors. Found a dragon amulet! Also rescued a very calm priest.

Back at the keep some kobolds attempted to break in but we held them off, and mended a broken door through the use of magic. Then a half dragon approached the gate and asked to fight our best warrior or else kill a woman and her children. Thorn went out to fight but lost, however the captives were released anyway. Thorn survived but just barely. Siege ended and we took a long rest.
