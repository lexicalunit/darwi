# ![](https://github.com/lexicalunit/darwi/blob/master/art/icon.png) Darwi Shis'urna

This repository holds information on my character including her character sheet, spell book, inventory, journal, and action cards such as spellcasting cards.

### [Darwi Shis'urna's Character Sheet](art/darwi.png)

## Todo
1. Print out updated spell cards, spell book, character sheet, journal, etc...
1. Add missing features to character sheet as indicated on previously printed out sheet.
1. Complete leveling up of Darwi to level 2!
1. Create a somewhat more detailed backstory for Darwi and how she came to be a professor and about her motivations.
1. Provide a more complete description of Darwi's appearance.
1. Detail the contents of Darwi's inventory, pockets, and backpack.
1. Read through all of the 5e Player's Handbook so I'm more familiar with lore and game mechanics.

I love this picture! This is exactly the right color skin and hair that I was thinking of for Darwi, or maybe just a little darker. However Darwi's eyes should be solid white instead of blue with a pupil. I also love the clothing and I imagine Darwi wearing something very similar though less tattered looking. *[Source: http://aditya777.deviantart.com/art/Female-wizard-01-282665866]*

Very similar to the wizard by aditya777, but the horns on this character make her look more like Darwi. I like the clothing on this character as well, and I'm really digging the chains, feathers, and brooch. The expression on her face is exactly the kind of expression I imagine Darwi using most of the time: Real intensity and perceptiveness shown in the eyes, yet also the suggestion of boredom when you look at the face as a whole. *[Source: http://aditya777.deviantart.com/art/Hunter-03-273731716]*

I like the look of this Tiefling. Espeically the shape of the horns and the short wavy hair style. The color isn't right though. Darwi has gray skin and hair, and solid white eyes. *[Source: http://banzayaz.deviantart.com/art/tiefling-252757694]*

I also like the look of this character, except for the color again which isn't quite right. The glasses are a nice touch, and would fit well for a Sage/Professor type character. I imagine Darwi though would be wearing something a bit more conservative. Flowing worlock-esque robes, with a vaguely academic look to them. *[Source: http://sirtiefling.deviantart.com/art/Dame-Tiefling-Igniferous-415126408]*
